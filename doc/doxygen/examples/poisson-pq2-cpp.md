@dontinclude{lineno} poisson-pq2.cc

The following explains how to solve the Poisson equation
using [dune-functions][]. The full example @ref source-poisson-pq2-cpp
can be found in the `examples/` subdirectory.



### Local assemblers

The program first includes the required headers and then defines
free functions for assembling the Poisson problem.
The function `getLocalMatrix()` implements the assembler
of the local stiffness matrix for the bilinear form
@f$(u,v) \mapsto \int_\Omega \nabla u(x)\nabla v(x)dx@f$.

@skip LABEL_END_INCLUDES
@until LABEL_END_GETLOCALMATRIX

The `getVolumeTerm()` functions implements the local assembler
for the volume right hand side term @f$\int_\Omega f(x)v(x)dx@f$.

@until LABEL_END_GETVOLUMETERM



### Global assembler

Assemble the global matrix pattern.

@until LABEL_END_GETPATTERN

Assembly of matrix and right-hand-side.

@until LABEL_END_ASSEMBLELAPLACEMATRIX



### Helper functions

Treatment of boundary condition.

@until LABEL_END_BOUNDARYTREATMENT

Create a mixed grid containing triangles and quadrilaterals.

@until LABEL_END_CREATEMIXEDGRID



### Setup and initialization

Initialize MPI

@until LABEL_END_SETUP



### Create grid and finite element basis

Create a mixed grid and obtain a leaf grid view.

@note
A `GridView` is a view to a subset of the grid's elements, vertices, ...
that should be stored by value and can be copied cheaply.
Grids in [dune][] are in general hierarchical and composed by elements
on several levels. The discretization usually lives on the set of
most refined elements that is denote the leaf `GridView` in dune.

@until LABEL_END_CREATEGRID

As a next step the program creates a global finite element
basis on the `GridView`.

@until LABEL_END_MAKEBASIS
